### About my Game

This is my command line Battle Ships game which allows the user to play against the computer by guessing its fleets locations.

This game is run on the Code Institute mock terminal on heroku.

### How to Play

- Once the program is ran, the user can input their name and view the game instructions by typing "yes" in the terminal.
- The instructions inform the user of how to play the game.
- The user then chooses their diffuculty (easy, medium or hard).
- The user then choses their grid size, please note that the smallest size can be 3x3 and the largest 10x10.
- Once the user proceeds with desired grid size, they then start the game loop.
- Once the user has correctly guessed and sunk the enemies ships, they have won the game!
